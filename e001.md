## Comment from projecteuler.net:

To get a more efficient solution you could also calculate the sum of the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by three, plus the sum of the numbers less than 1000 that are divisible by 5.
But as you have summed numbers divisible by 15 twice, you would have to subtract the sum of the numbers divisible by 15.

If we now define a function:
```
Function SumDivisibleBy(n):
  Details to be filled in
End Function
```

Then the answer would be 
```
SumDivisibleBy(3) + SumDivisibleBy(5) - SumDivisibleBy(15)
```

Let us look at the details of our function and take as example n=3.
We would have to add
```
3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + ... 999 = 3*(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 333)
```
For n=5 we would get: 
```
5 + 10 + 15 + 20 + ... + 995 = 5 * (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 199)
```
Now note that 995/5 = 199 but also  999/5 rounded down to the next integer.
In many programming languages there exists a separate operator for that: div or / 
If we also note that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + p = p * (p + 1) / 2 our program becomes:
```
target = 999

Function SumDivisibleBy(n) 
  p = target div n
  return n * ( p* (p+1)) div 2
EndFunction

Output SumDivisibleBy(3) + SumDivisibleBy(5) - SumDivisibleBy(15)
```
