The problem here asks for the sum of even terms in the fibonacchi sequence up to a certain value.
The fibonacchi sequence (see knuth for an excellent treatment) begins like:
0 1 1 2 3 5 7 13 ...
The n-the term (n > 2) is defined as the sum of the previous two terms.

The fibonacchi sequence is often used as an illustration for recursion.
One method will calculate the n-th fib number https://medium.com/launch-school/recursive-fibonnaci-method-explained-d82215c5498e
However, for the given problem, I start from  the value f(n) and would need to reverse it, either from the closed form formula
